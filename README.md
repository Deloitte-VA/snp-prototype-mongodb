# snp-prototype-mongodb
A project for standing up MongoDB in a docker container.  This is bootstrapped with a large amount of generated ontology data.

This is used to support the [Semantic Normalization Prototype](https://github.com/jlgrock/snp-prototype).  Documentation on how to use this can also be found there.
